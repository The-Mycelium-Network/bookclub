# Chapter 1

- [A Brief History of JavaScript by the Creator of JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-9fnjzmXWA)
- [ECMA-262 Specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)
- [TC39](https://tc39.es/)

While using the browser console or Nodejs on the command line are both good solutions, I have found [RunJS](https://runjs.app/) to be simply amazing. It is also cross-platform. From their website:

> Explore and experiment with JavaScript and TypeScript, visualise your ideas and get instant feedback as you type.

Do note that it is still important to know and understand how to use the browserâ€™s developer tools so, I would use RunJS with the tools offered by the browser.

A [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XvRxvbOT9o) of some of the concepts from this chapter.

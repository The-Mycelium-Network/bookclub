Gain command-line shortcuts and processing techniques, install new tools and diagnose problems, and fully customize your terminal for a better, more powerful workflow.

The book is about the command line and the terminal and it's aimed squarely at the beginner audience wanting to learn about the command line.

It offers a gentle approach but spans over many topics, starts with navigating your computer in the terminal, to tricks and shortcuts, to installing software, to string manipulation techniques (which the command line is perfect for), to techniques on "how to shoot yourself in the foot" and finally how to customise your terminal.
